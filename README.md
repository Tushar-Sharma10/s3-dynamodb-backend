# Terraform Remote Backend: S3 + DynamoDB

This repository contains Terraform configuration files to **bootstrap a remote backend** using:  
- **Amazon S3** for storing the Terraform state file  
- **Amazon DynamoDB** for state locking and consistency  

By storing your Terraform state remotely, you can collaborate with your team safely and avoid local state file issues.
